  <p>The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) also known as the Persian Lion and Eurasian lion, is a subspecies of lion. The only place in the wild where this species is found is in the Gir Forest of Gujarat, India. In 2010, the Gujarat government reported 411 Asiatic lions were sighted in the Gir forest; a rise of 52 over the last census of 2005. The Asiatic lion is one of the five major big cats found in India, the others being the Bengal tiger, the Indian leopard, the snow leopard and clouded leopard.</p>

  <h3>Leopard  <span>(Panthera pardus)</span></h3>
  <p>The leopard, (Panthera pardus), is a member of the Felidae family and the smallest of the four "big cats" in the genus Panthera, the other three being the tiger, lion, andjaguar. The leopard was once distributed across eastern and southern Asia and Africa, from Siberia to South Africa, but its range of distribution has decreased radically because of hunting and loss of habitat. It is now chiefly found in sub-Saharan Africa; there are also fragmented populations in the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka, Indochina, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. Because of its declining range and population, it is listed as a "Near Threatened" species on the IUCN Red List.

  <p>The snow leopard (Panthera uncia or Uncia uncia) is a moderately large cat native to the mountain ranges of Central Asia. The classification of this species has been subject to change and is still classified as Uncia uncia by MSW3 as of 2000 and CITES Appendix I. However with more recent genetic studies, the snow leopard is now generally considered as Panthera uncia and classified as such by IUCN. Classically, two subspecies have been attributed but genetic differences between the two have not been settled. The snow leopard remains on the endangered species list classified as C1

  <h3>Indian Wolf <span>(Canis lupus pallipes)</span></h3>
  <p>The Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) is a gray wolf subspecies inhabiting South andsouth-western Asia. Some experts have suggested at least some C. lupus pallipes populations be re-classified acanid species distinct from C. lupus. Other experts believe it may be the wolf subspecies from which the domestic dog evolved, pointing to its small size and comparatively docile behaviour, although they are also known man-eaters. </p>

  <h3>Small Indian civet   <span>(Viverricula indica)</span></h3>
  <p>The small Indian civet (Viverricula indica) or rasse is a species of civet found across southand South-east Asia as well as in the Indonesian archipelago. The Assamese namejohamaal refers to its glandular odour similar to a scented rice variety called joha. The species has been introduced to Madagascar. It is slender, agile in climbing trees, has no erectile mane and lives in holes in rocky and brushy locations. In captivity, it is easily tamed and feeds on small animals, which it catches with cat-like dexterity. </p>

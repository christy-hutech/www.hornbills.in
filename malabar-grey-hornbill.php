Over 2000 food items delivered during entire nesting cycle. Moult of flight feathers by female noted, incubation is 40 days, fledgling period is 46 days. Female emerges together with chicks, nesting success in one study was 24 of 27 nests with chicks fledged. Sedentary, but moves locally. Flocks of up to 20 birds in fruiting trees.</p>

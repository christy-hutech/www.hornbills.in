Another population is found in Sri Lanka. They are often found in forests near streams and small rivers.

        <p>From one study, it is known that one fig species and <i>Putranjiva</i> (Euphorbiaceae) were the main food species in breeding season, but 17 species recorded in non-breeding season (mainly one fig species and <i>Strychnos</i> (Loganiaceae). Apart from fruits, they also eat termites, fish, crabs, lizards, snakes, young birds from their nest, and other small animals. They also come to the ground to pick up fallen fruits or animal prey.</p>

        <p>These hornbills are found in moist forests, moving around in small groups of up to 10 birds, but are usually found in larger groups at fruiting trees. Sedentary, but makes local movements in search of fruiting trees.  Gathers in flocks of around 35-40 birds around good feeding areas or roosts, makes loud whistles on arrival in roost. Up to 58 birds have been seen in a single roost site. They enjoy a dust-bath, for which they have to come down from their tree perches on to open ground. The female hornbill goes into her nest in March or April, and rears 2 or 3 chicks. Nest trees can be 3 to 15 m high. <i>Tetrameles nudiflora</i> and <i>Terminalia bellerica</i> have been reported as nest trees. Female seals the cavity with poop and pulp, clutch - 2 to 4 eggs, incubation is 29-30 days, female emerges out of nest earlier when the oldest chick is 10-35 days old, chicks stay a bit longer, female helps male feed the chicks, fledging period is 49 days.</p>

        <p>Fairly common in good habitat in moist forest. Loss due to habitat degradation, fragmentation, hunting also an issue in Orissa and some other areas. The species has a large range of 851,423 sq. km, however only 1% is estimated to be optimal habitat. Fairly common in good habitat in moist forest.
